# The Ultimate Anime Filler Guide

This website, `www.animefillerlist.com`, provides community-created lists to help anime viewers skip filler episodes.

**What is Filler?**

Filler episodes are anime scenes not found in the original manga source material.  They are created because anime production often outpaces the manga's release schedule.  Filler episodes generally don't advance the main storyline and are often considered lower in visual and narrative quality.
