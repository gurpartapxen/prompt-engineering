explain AI to a 5 year old kid,"Imagine you have a really smart puppy.  You teach it tricks, like ""sit"" and ""fetch.""  The more you teach it, the better it gets at those tricks, right?

AI is like that smart puppy, but instead of tricks, we teach it to do things on a computer. We show it lots and lots of pictures of cats, and then it learns to recognize cats in new pictures.  Or we show it lots of words, and then it can learn to write stories (though maybe not very good ones yet!).

It's not really thinking like you and me, but it's learning to follow instructions and do things based on what it's been taught.  It's like a super-powered puppy that can do amazing things on a computer!
